# Best Claude Code Plugins & Skills (2026)

Looking for the best Claude Code plugins to supercharge your workflow? This guide covers 20 production-ready plugins and agent skills — from engineering and DevOps to marketing, product management, and C-level advisory.

All plugins listed here are open-source (MIT), tested in production, and installable in one command.

## What's the Difference Between Plugins and Skills?

**Claude Code plugins** use the `.claude-plugin/plugin.json` format and install via `/plugin install`. **Agent skills** use `SKILL.md` files and work across Claude Code, Codex, Gemini CLI, Cursor, and 8 other coding agents.

This repo provides **both formats** — every skill includes a `.claude-plugin` directory for native Claude Code plugin support, plus a `SKILL.md` for cross-platform compatibility.
