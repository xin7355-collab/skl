# Agent Skills for OpenAI Codex CLI

Use 345 production-ready agent skills with OpenAI Codex CLI. Every skill in this collection works natively with Codex via the `.codex/skills/` directory format.

---

## Quick Install

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/alirezarezvani/claude-skills.git
cd claude-skills

# Option 1: Install all skills for Codex
./scripts/codex-install.sh

# Option 2: Convert specific skills
./scripts/convert.sh --skill frontend-design --tool codex
./scripts/convert.sh --skill autoresearch-agent --tool codex

# Option 3: Convert all skills at once
./scripts/convert.sh --all --tool codex
```

### How It Works

Codex reads agent skills from `.codex/skills/<skill-name>/SKILL.md` in your project or home directory. The `convert.sh` script transforms Claude Code's SKILL.md format into Codex-compatible instructions, preserving all workflows, slash commands, and references.

## Codex-Specific Tips

### AGENTS.md Fallback

If your Codex setup uses `AGENTS.md` instead of the skills directory, you can use the generated agents file:

```bash
# Copy the bundled AGENTS.md to your project
cp claude-skills/agents/AGENTS.md ~/.codex/AGENTS.md
```

### Using with `--full-auto`

Skills work seamlessly with Codex's auto-approval mode:

```bash
# Run a skill in full-auto mode
codex exec --full-auto "Use the frontend-design skill to build a dashboard component"

# Run autoresearch overnight
codex exec --full-auto "Use autoresearch-agent to optimize src/api/search.py for response time"
```

### Project-Level vs Global

```bash
# Project-level (only this repo)
cp -r claude-skills/.codex/skills/ ./.codex/skills/

# Global (available everywhere)
cp -r claude-skills/.codex/skills/ ~/.codex/skills/
```
