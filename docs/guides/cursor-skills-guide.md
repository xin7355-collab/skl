# Cursor Agent Skills Guide

Use 345 production-ready agent skills with Cursor IDE. Every skill converts to Cursor's rules format and installs via the `.cursor/skills/` directory.

---

## Quick Install

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/alirezarezvani/claude-skills.git
cd claude-skills

# Convert all skills to Cursor format
./scripts/convert.sh --all --tool cursor

# Or convert individual skills
./scripts/convert.sh --skill frontend-design --tool cursor
./scripts/convert.sh --skill pr-review-expert --tool cursor
```

### How It Works

Cursor reads agent rules from `.cursor/rules/` and `.cursorrules` files. The convert script transforms SKILL.md files into Cursor-compatible rule sets, preserving workflows, decision frameworks, and domain knowledge.

## Cursor-Specific Integration

### Using with Cursor's Subagents

Cursor's multi-model subagent system works well with skills:

```
# In Cursor's Composer, reference a skill:
@skill frontend-design Build a dashboard with charts and data tables

# Or use slash commands from the skill:
/design:component Create a pricing card with toggle for monthly/annual
```

### Project Rules

Add skills to your `.cursorrules` for project-wide availability:

```bash
# Append skill instructions to cursor rules
cat .cursor/skills/frontend-design/SKILL.md >> .cursorrules
```
