# Gemini CLI Agent Skills Guide

Use 345 production-ready agent skills with Gemini CLI. Every skill in this collection is compatible with Gemini's agent skills specification and installs via the `.gemini/skills/` directory.

---

## Quick Install

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/alirezarezvani/claude-skills.git
cd claude-skills

# Run the Gemini setup script (converts and installs all skills)
./scripts/gemini-install.sh

# Or convert individual skills
./scripts/convert.sh --skill frontend-design --tool gemini
./scripts/convert.sh --skill autoresearch-agent --tool gemini
```

### How It Works

Gemini CLI reads agent skills from `.gemini/skills/<skill-name>/SKILL.md` in your project directory. The setup script converts all skills to Gemini-compatible format, including `gemini-extension.json` for the extension registry.

## Why Use Skills with Gemini CLI?

Gemini CLI's free tier gives you **unlimited evaluation calls** — perfect for:

- **Autoresearch loops** — run overnight experiments with zero API cost
- **Content optimization** — LLM-judge evaluators for headlines, copy, prompts
- **Code review** — systematic multi-pass reviews without burning tokens

### Free Evaluators with Gemini

The autoresearch-agent skill includes LLM judge evaluators that work with Gemini's free tier:

```bash
# Set up an autoresearch experiment using Gemini as the evaluator
python scripts/setup_experiment.py \
  --domain marketing \
  --name headline-optimization \
  --target content/headlines.md \
  --eval "python evaluate.py" \
  --metric ctr_score \
  --direction higher \
  --evaluator llm_judge_content

# The evaluator calls gemini CLI for scoring — free!
```
