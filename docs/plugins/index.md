| `pulse` | Multi-source recency research (Reddit / HN / X / web) with sentiment |
| `litreview` | Academic literature review with PICO/SPIDER frameworks |
| `grants` | NIH grant-funding intelligence |
| `dossier` | Decision-grade entity research |
| `patent` | Patent prior-art and IP landscape |
| `syllabus` | Course supplementary reading lists (bundled DOCX generator) |
| `notebooklm` | Google NotebookLM browser automation |

### Productivity (5 plugins)

| Plugin | What it does |
|---|---|
| `capture-skill` | Brain-dump-to-action workspace |

### Engineering favorites

`pw` (Playwright Pro), `self-improving-agent`, `agenthub`, `autoresearch-agent`, `llm-wiki`, `slo-architect`, `chaos-engineering`, `kubernetes-operator`, `feature-flags-architect`, `karpathy-coder`, `write-a-skill`, `security-guidance`, `universal-scraping-architect` — browse them all in [Engineering — Advanced](../skills/engineering/index.md).

## Plugin Structure

Every plugin follows the same minimal schema for maximum portability:

```json
{
  "name": "plugin-name",
  "description": "What it does",
  "version": "2.10.0",
  "author": { "name": "Author Name" },
  "homepage": "https://...",
  "repository": "https://...",
  "license": "MIT",
  "skills": ["./skills/<name>"]
}
```

**No extension fields of any kind** — Claude Code's manifest validator rejects the entire `plugin.json` on any unrecognized key (issue #954), and `scripts/check_plugin_json.py` hard-fails manifests carrying extras in CI. Authoring metadata lives in a sibling file the validator never reads, `.claude-plugin/authoring-notes.json`, holding at most two keys:

- **`source`** (object) — provenance metadata for Path-B megaprompt-derived skills (productivity, marketing, research).
- **`attribution`** (object) — credit metadata for skills derived from external MIT-licensed work (`caveman`, `grill-me`, `grill-with-docs`, `skillopt-sleep`, `book-to-skill`, and others). Upstream credit must also remain in the plugin's `README.md`/`LICENSE`.

!!! info "ClawHub Registry"
    Plugins are distributed via [ClawHub](https://clawhub.com) as the public registry. The `cs-` prefix is used only when a slug is already taken by another publisher — repo folder names remain unchanged.

## Compatibility Matrix

| Platform | Bundle Install | Standalone Install | Slash Commands | Agents |
|----------|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|
| **Claude Code** | :material-check: | :material-check: | :material-check: | :material-check: |
| **OpenAI Codex** | :material-check: | :material-check: | :material-close: | :material-close: |
| **Gemini CLI** | :material-check: | :material-check: | :material-close: | :material-close: |
| **OpenClaw** | :material-check: | :material-check: | :material-close: | :material-close: |

!!! tip "Full feature support"
    Slash commands (like `/cs:research`, `/pw:generate`) and agent spawning (like `cs-research`) are Claude Code features. On other platforms the underlying skills and Python tools work — just without the command/agent wrappers.

## FAQ

??? question "What's the difference between a bundle and a standalone plugin?"
    **Bundles** install all skills in a domain (for example, `marketing-skills` installs all 48 marketing skills). **Standalone** plugins install a single skill or toolkit (for example, `pulse` installs just the recency-research skill). Standalone plugins are subsets of their parent bundle when applicable — installing both is safe but redundant.

??? question "What is the research orchestrator?"
    `research-orchestrator` is a **hybrid router + fallback** that classifies any research question deterministically and either delegates to one of six specialists (pulse, litreview, grants, dossier, patent, syllabus, notebooklm) at ≥2-signal confidence, or runs its own 8-step plan-decompose-search-synthesize-cite workflow when no specialist matches. Routing transparency is mandatory — it never delegates silently.

??? question "Can I install multiple plugins?"
    Yes. Plugins are designed to coexist without conflicts. Each skill is self-contained with no cross-dependencies.

??? question "Do plugins require API keys or paid services?"
    No. All Python tools use the standard library only. Some skills reference external services (AWS, Google Workspace, Stripe, NIH RePORTER, Reddit/HN APIs) but follow a BYOK (bring-your-own-key) pattern — you use your own accounts.

??? question "How do I update plugins?"
    Re-run the install command. Plugins follow semantic versioning aligned with repository releases.

??? question "What is ClawHub?"
    [ClawHub](https://clawhub.com) is the public registry for Claude Code plugins — think of it as npm for AI agent skills. The `cs-` prefix is used only when a plugin slug conflicts with another publisher.

??? question "Can I use skills without installing anything?"
    Yes. There are [6 Custom GPTs for ChatGPT](../custom-gpts.md) that package Agent Skills into a conversational interface — no installation, no API keys. Just click and chat.
