<p class="domain-count">3 persona-based agents for role embodiment</p>

</div>

Personas go beyond task agents. They define how an agent thinks, prioritizes, and communicates — complete with identity, judgment frameworks, and curated skill loadouts.

### Personas vs Task Agents

| | Task Agents | Personas |
|---|---|---|
| **Purpose** | Execute a specific task | Embody a role across tasks |
| **Scope** | Single domain | Cross-domain, curated |
| **Voice** | Neutral, professional | Personality-driven with backstory |
| **Workflows** | Single-step | Multi-step with decision points |
| **Use case** | "Do this task" | "Think like this person" |

Both coexist. Use task agents for focused work, personas for ongoing collaboration.
