## What This Plugin Provides

### 13 cs-* Agents (in `agents/`)

Each agent wraps an existing c-level skill and adds:
- A distinct cognitive voice (numerate skeptic, narrative-first, etc.)
- Forcing questions specific to the role
- Workflow orchestration tied to skill Python tools
- Output template: Bottom Line → What → Why → How to Act → Your Decision

See [`references/persona-voices.md`](https://github.com/alirezarezvani/claude-skills/tree/main/c-level-agents/references/persona-voices.md) for voice specs.

### 21 /cs:* Slash Commands (in `skills/`)

**Forcing-question office hours (12):**
- `/cs:office-hours` — YC-style 6-question intake
- `/cs:cfo-review` — unit economics, runway, dilution
- `/cs:cmo-review` — ICP, CAC payback, positioning
- `/cs:cpo-review` — RICE, JTBD, North Star, PMF
- `/cs:cro-review` — pipeline coverage, win rate, NRR
- `/cs:cto-review` — architecture risk, scaling cliff
- `/cs:ciso-review` — threat model, blast radius, compliance
- `/cs:gc-review` — contracts, IP, regulatory, term sheets
- `/cs:cdo-review` — training-data rights, data products, data assets
- `/cs:caio-review` — model selection, evals, AI risk, AI costs
- `/cs:cco-review` — GRR/NRR decomposition, churn root cause, CS coverage
- `/cs:vpe-review` — DORA metrics, cycle time, eng hiring funnel, team structure

**Strategic sprint pipeline (5):**
- `/cs:brief` → `/cs:boardroom` → `/cs:decide` → `/cs:execute` → `/cs:post-mortem`

**Meta + safety (4):**
- `/cs:founder-mode` — auto-routes to the right C-role
- `/cs:onboard` — founder interview → `company-context.md`
- `/cs:cross-eval` — multi-model consensus
- `/cs:freeze` — cooldown lock on a decision

## Quick Start

```
/cs:onboard                          # populate company context first
/cs:office-hours "should we hire a VP Sales?"
/cs:founder-mode "runway pressure"   # auto-routes to CFO
/cs:boardroom briefs/pricing-v3.md   # full panel
```

## Architecture

```
User question
   │
   ├─ Single-role? → cs-{role}-advisor agent
   │                     ↓
   │                  /cs:{role}-review command (forcing Qs)

   │
   └─ Multi-role?  → /cs:boardroom
                        ↓
                     6-phase deliberation (Phase 2 isolation)
                        ↓
                     /cs:decide → decision-logger (two-layer memory)
                        ↓
                     /cs:execute → 90-day plan
```

## Integration Points

- **Existing 33 c-level skills** — wrapped, not replaced
- **decision-logger** — every `/cs:decide` writes here
- **chief-of-staff** — routing layer the agent orchestrates
- **board-meeting** — protocol the `/cs:boardroom` command runs
- **llm-wiki** — optional persistent memory bridge (see [`references/llm-wiki-bridge.md`](https://github.com/alirezarezvani/claude-skills/tree/main/c-level-agents/references/llm-wiki-bridge.md))
- **executive-mentor** — adversarial `/em:*` commands stack cleanly on top

## Design Principles

1. **Voice is bookended, analysis is neutral.**
2. **Artifacts over chat.** Every command produces a Markdown artifact the next command consumes.
3. **Phase 2 isolation in boardroom.** Independent thinking before cross-examination.
4. **Graceful degradation.** `/cs:cross-eval` falls back to Claude-only.
5. **No paid dependencies.** All Python tools are stdlib-only.
