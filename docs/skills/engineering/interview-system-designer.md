Comprehensive interview loop planning and calibration support for role-based hiring systems.

## Overview

Use this skill to create structured interview loops, standardize question quality, and keep hiring signal consistent across interviewers.

## Core Capabilities

- Interview loop planning by role and level
- Round-by-round focus and timing recommendations
- Suggested question sets by round type
- Framework support for scoring and calibration
- Bias-reduction and process consistency guidance

## Quick Start

```bash
# Generate a loop plan for a role and level
python3 scripts/interview_planner.py --role "Senior Software Engineer" --level senior

# JSON output for integration with internal tooling
python3 scripts/interview_planner.py --role "Product Manager" --level mid --json
```

## Recommended Workflow

1. Run `scripts/interview_planner.py` to generate a baseline loop.
2. Align rounds to role-specific competencies.
3. Validate scoring rubric consistency with interview panel leads.
4. Review for bias controls before rollout.
5. Recalibrate quarterly using hiring outcome data.

## Common Pitfalls

- Overweighting one round while ignoring other competency signals
- Using unstructured interviews without standardized scoring
- Skipping calibration sessions for interviewers
- Changing hiring bar without documenting rationale

## Best Practices

1. Keep round objectives explicit and non-overlapping.
2. Require evidence for each score recommendation.
3. Use the same baseline rubric across comparable roles.
4. Revisit loop design based on quality-of-hire outcomes.
