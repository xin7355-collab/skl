# notebooklm

Browser-automation skill for controlling Google's NotebookLM (https://notebooklm.google.com). The only **browser-automation shape** in the v2 collection — distinct from the research-pack convention.

## Critical Portability Notice

> **Requires:** A browser automation environment (Claude Code CLI with computer-use, Claude Chrome Extension, or equivalent). Skill will gracefully fail in non-automation contexts with a clear "not supported" message.

This skill cannot run in Claude.ai web (no browser automation). It detects environment at Step 0 and exits cleanly if unsupported.

## What this skill does

Four core actions controlled via the grill-me action-routing intake:

| Action | Q1 picks | UI flow |
|---|---|---|
| **Read/Extract** | 1 | Ask the notebook's chat a question, return clean response |
| **Add Sources** | 2 | Push URL / text / file / Google Doc / synthesized content into a notebook |
| **Generate Studio Outputs** | 3 | Audio Overview, Study Guide, Briefing Doc, Timeline, FAQ, Table of Contents, Infographic, Slides, Mind Map |
| **Create New Notebook** | 4 | Initialize with title + initial sources |

## Domain folder — research (semantic) vs shape difference

This skill lives in `research/` (with pulse/litreview/grants/dossier/patent/syllabus) because its **user-facing semantic domain** is research — users automate NotebookLM as part of their research workflow.

But the **technical shape** is completely different from the research-pack:
- No Consensus / Agent Integrity Rules
- No 1 q/sec rate limits (browser automation has different constraints)
- No DOCX generation (NotebookLM outputs come from NotebookLM itself)
- No three-count tracking
- Async discipline is fundamentally different (UI generation can take 5-10 min)

Users find it where they expect (research/), but it's the only research-domain skill with this shape.
