# c-level-agents — Founder-Mode Executive Team

A virtual C-suite for Claude Code. Eight cs-* agents with distinct cognitive voices, seventeen `/cs:*` slash commands, one artifact-driven pipeline.

This plugin is the **surface layer** on top of the 28 c-level skills already in this repo. The skills provide frameworks and Python tools; this plugin adds:

1. **Cognitive gearing** — each role has a voice and a forcing-question protocol
2. **Slash-command invocation** — `/cs:cfo-review`, `/cs:boardroom`, `/cs:founder-mode`
3. **Strategic sprint pipeline** — Brief → Boardroom → Decide → Execute → Post-mortem
4. **Multi-role boardroom** — 6-phase deliberation across all C-roles in one command
5. **Cross-model consensus** — high-stakes memos reviewed by Claude + Codex/Gemini

Built to outclass YC Garry Tan's `gstack` by extending the same patterns (slash-first, forcing questions, artifact handoffs) into the **business** domain: real CFO, CMO, CRO, General Counsel, Compliance — not just software-shipping personas.

## Quick Start

```
/cs:onboard                          # 6-question founder interview → company-context.md
/cs:office-hours <topic>             # YC-style 6-question interrogation
/cs:founder-mode <question>          # auto-routes to the right C-role
/cs:cfo-review <plan>                # numerate skeptic stress-tests unit economics
/cs:boardroom <brief>                # full panel deliberation, 6 phases
/cs:decide <memo>                    # logs decision to two-layer memory
```

## Agent Roster

| Agent | Voice | Wraps Skill |
|---|---|---|
| cs-cfo-advisor | Numerate skeptic — "show me the spreadsheet" | cfo-advisor |
| cs-cmo-advisor | Narrative-first — "what's the story?" | cmo-advisor |
| cs-cro-advisor | Pipeline-paranoid — "where's the coverage?" | cro-advisor |
| cs-cpo-advisor | JTBD-driven — "what job hired this?" | cpo-advisor |
| cs-coo-advisor | Execution OS — "what's the cadence?" | coo-advisor |
| cs-chro-advisor | People-systems — "comp band, ladder, level" | chro-advisor |
| cs-ciso-advisor | Risk-paranoid — "what's the blast radius?" | ciso-advisor |
| cs-chief-of-staff | Router & synthesist — orchestrates boardroom | chief-of-staff |

Existing `cs-ceo-advisor` and `cs-cto-advisor` live in `/agents/c-level/` and integrate seamlessly.

## Slash Command Map

**Forcing-question office hours (8)** — interrogate before advising
- `/cs:office-hours` — 6-question YC-style intake
- `/cs:cfo-review` `/cs:cmo-review` `/cs:cpo-review` `/cs:cro-review`
- `/cs:cto-review` `/cs:ciso-review` `/cs:gc-review`

**Strategic sprint pipeline (5)** — Think → Decide → Ship for business
- `/cs:brief` → `/cs:boardroom` → `/cs:decide` → `/cs:execute` → `/cs:post-mortem`

**Meta + safety (4)**
- `/cs:founder-mode` — auto-routes to the right C-role
- `/cs:onboard` — founder interview, populates `~/.claude/company-context.md`
- `/cs:cross-eval` — multi-model consensus (Claude + Codex/Gemini, graceful degradation)
- `/cs:freeze` — locks a strategic decision for cooldown period

## Design Principles

- **Voice is bookended, analysis is neutral.** Persona shows in the opening line and closing handoff; the body stays rigorous.
- **Artifacts over chat.** Every command produces a Markdown artifact the next command can consume.
- **Two-layer memory.** Raw transcripts kept for reference; only approved decisions feed forward (via `decision-logger`).
- **Phase 2 isolation.** In `/cs:boardroom`, each role thinks independently before cross-examination.
- **Graceful degradation.** `/cs:cross-eval` falls back to Claude-only if no other models are configured.

## What's Different vs `gstack`

| | gstack | c-level-agents |
|---|---|---|
| Roles | ~6 software-shipping personas | 10 real C-suite roles + General Counsel lane |
| Domain | Code shipping only | Business + compliance + GTM + finance + product |
| Frameworks | Scope cut, sprint pipeline | RICE, JTBD, OKR, Wardley, ADKAR, 8-dim org health |
| Memory | Postgres + pgvector (separate repo) | Markdown via llm-wiki bridge (stdlib-only) |
| Voice | Default Claude voice | Per-role cognitive style |
| Compliance | None | ra-qm-team integration (ISO/MDR/FDA/GDPR) |
| Boardroom | Sequential review chain | 6-phase deliberation with isolation |
