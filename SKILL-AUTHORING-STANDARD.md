# Skill Name

You are an expert in [domain]. Your goal is [specific outcome for the user].

## Before Starting

**Check for context first:**
If `[domain]-context.md` exists, read it before asking questions. Use that context and only ask for information not already covered or specific to this task.

Gather this context (ask if not provided):

### 1. Current State
- What exists today?
- What's working / not working?

### 2. Goals
- What outcome do they want?
- What constraints exist?

### 3. [Domain-Specific Context]
- [Questions specific to this skill]

## How This Skill Works

This skill supports [N] modes:

### Mode 1: Build from Scratch
When starting fresh — no existing [artifact] to work with.

### Mode 2: Optimize Existing
When improving something that already exists. Analyze what's working, identify gaps, recommend changes.

### Mode 3: [Situation-Specific]
When [specific scenario that needs a different approach].

## [Core Content Sections]

[Action-oriented workflow. Not a textbook — a practitioner guiding you through it.]

[Tables for structured information. Checklists for processes. Examples for clarity.]

## Proactive Triggers

Surface these issues WITHOUT being asked when you notice them in context:

- [Trigger 1: specific condition → what to flag]
- [Trigger 2: specific condition → what to flag]
- [Trigger 3: specific condition → what to flag]

## Output Artifacts

| When you ask for... | You get... |
|---------------------|------------|
| [Common request 1] | [Specific deliverable with format] |
| [Common request 2] | [Specific deliverable with format] |
| [Common request 3] | [Specific deliverable with format] |

## Communication

All output follows the structured communication standard:
- **Bottom line first** — answer before explanation
- **What + Why + How** — every finding has all three
- **Actions have owners and deadlines** — no "we should consider"
- **Confidence tagging** — 🟢 verified / 🟡 medium / 🔴 assumed

## Related Skills

- **skill-name**: Use when [specific scenario]. NOT for [disambiguation].
- **skill-name**: Use when [specific scenario]. NOT for [disambiguation].
- **skill-name**: Use when [specific scenario]. NOT for [disambiguation].

## The 10 Patterns

### Pattern 1: Context-First

Every skill checks for domain context before asking questions. Only ask for what's missing.

**Implementation:**
```markdown
## Before Starting

**Check for context first:**
If `marketing-context.md` exists, read it before asking questions.
Use that context and only ask for information not already covered.
```

**Domain context files:**

| Domain | Context File | Created By |
|--------|-------------|-----------|
| C-Suite | `company-context.md` | `/cs:setup` (cs-onboard skill) |
| Marketing | `marketing-context.md` | marketing-context skill |
| Engineering | `project-context.md` | codebase-onboarding skill |
| Product | `product-context.md` | product-strategist skill |
| RA/QM | `regulatory-context.md` | regulatory-affairs-head skill |

**Rules:**
- If context exists → read it, use it, only ask for gaps
- If context doesn't exist → offer to create it (auto-draft from available info)
- Never dump all questions at once — conversational, one section at a time
- Push for verbatim language — exact customer/user phrases beat polished descriptions

---

### Pattern 2: Practitioner Voice

Every skill opens with an expert persona and clear goal. Not a textbook — a senior practitioner coaching you.

**Implementation:**
```markdown
You are an expert in [domain]. Your goal is [outcome].
```

**Rules:**
- Write as someone who has done this 100 times
- Use contractions, direct language
- If something sounds like a Wikipedia article, rewrite it
- Opinionated > neutral. State what works and what doesn't.
- "Do X" beats "You might consider X"
- Industry jargon is fine when talking to practitioners — explain when talking to founders

**Anti-patterns:**
- ❌ "This skill provides comprehensive coverage of..."
- ❌ "The following section outlines the various approaches to..."
- ❌ "It is recommended that one should consider..."
- ✅ "You are an expert in SaaS pricing. Your goal is to help design pricing that captures value."
- ✅ "Lead with their world, not yours."
- ✅ "If it sounds like marketing copy, rewrite it."

---

### Pattern 3: Multi-Mode Workflows

Most skills have 2-3 natural entry points. Design for all of them.

**Implementation:**
```markdown
## How This Skill Works

### Mode 1: Build from Scratch
When starting fresh — [describe the greenfield scenario].

### Mode 2: Optimize Existing  
When [artifact] exists but isn't performing. Analyze → identify gaps → recommend.

### Mode 3: [Situation-Specific]
When [edge case or specific scenario that needs a different approach].
```

**Common mode pairs:**

| Skill Type | Mode 1 | Mode 2 | Mode 3 |
|-----------|--------|--------|--------|
| CRO skills | Audit a page | Redesign flow | A/B test specific element |
| Content skills | Write new | Rewrite/optimize | Repurpose for channel |
| SEO skills | Full audit | Fix specific issue | Competitive gap analysis |
| Strategy skills | Create plan | Review/critique plan | Pivot existing plan |
| Analytics skills | Set up tracking | Debug tracking | Analyze data |

**Rules:**
- Mode 2 (optimize) should ask for current performance data
- If user has performance data → use it to inform recommendations
- Each mode should be self-contained (don't assume they read the other modes)

---

### Pattern 4: Related Skills Navigation

Every skill ends with a curated list of related skills. Not just links — **when to use each and when NOT to.**

**Implementation:**
```markdown
## Related Skills

- **copywriting**: For landing page and web copy. NOT for email sequences or ad copy.
- **page-cro**: For optimizing any marketing page. NOT for signup flows (use signup-flow-cro).
- **email-sequence**: For lifecycle/nurture emails. NOT for cold outreach (use cold-email).
```

**Rules:**
- Include 3-7 related skills (not all of them — curate)
- Each entry: skill name + WHEN to use + WHEN NOT TO (disambiguation)
- Cross-references must be bidirectional (A mentions B, B mentions A)
- Include cross-domain references when relevant (e.g., marketing skill → business-growth skill)
- Group by relationship type if >5: "Works with", "Instead of", "After this"

---

### Pattern 5: Reference Separation

SKILL.md is the workflow. Reference docs are the knowledge base. Keep them separate.

**Implementation:**
```
skill-name/
├── SKILL.md              # ≤10KB — what to do, how to decide, when to act
├── references/
│   ├── frameworks.md      # Deep framework catalog
│   ├── benchmarks.md      # Industry data and benchmarks
│   ├── platform-specs.md  # Platform-specific details
│   └── examples.md        # Real-world examples
├── templates/
│   └── template.md        # User-fillable templates
└── scripts/
    └── tool.py            # Python automation
```

**Rules:**
- SKILL.md ≤10KB — if it's longer, move content to references
- SKILL.md links to references inline: `See [references/frameworks.md](references/frameworks.md) for the full catalog.`
- References are loaded on demand — zero startup cost
- Each reference doc is self-contained (can be read independently)
- Templates are user-fillable files with clear placeholder markers

---

### Pattern 6: Proactive Triggers

Skills surface issues without being asked when they detect patterns in context.

**Implementation:**
```markdown
## Proactive Triggers

Surface these without being asked:

- **[Condition]** → [What to flag and why]
- **[Condition]** → [What to flag and why]
```

**Rules:**
- 4-6 triggers per skill
- Each trigger: specific condition + business consequence
- Triggers should be things the user wouldn't think to ask about
- Format: condition → flag → recommended action
- Don't trigger on obvious things — trigger on hidden risks

**Examples:**
- SEO: "Keyword cannibalization detected — two pages targeting the same term" → flag
- Pricing: "Conversion rate >40% — likely underpriced" → flag
- Content: "No content updated in 6+ months" → flag
- CRO: "Form has >7 fields with no multi-step" → flag

---

### Pattern 7: Output Artifacts

Map common requests to specific, concrete deliverables.

**Implementation:**
```markdown
## Output Artifacts

| When you ask for... | You get... |
|---------------------|------------|
| "Help with pricing" | Pricing recommendation with tier structure, value metrics, and competitive positioning |
| "Audit my SEO" | SEO scorecard (0-100) with prioritized fixes and quick wins |
```

**Rules:**
- 4-6 artifacts per skill
- Each artifact has a specific format (scorecard, matrix, plan, audit, template)
- Artifacts are actionable — not just analysis, but recommendations with next steps
- Include what the output looks like (table? checklist? narrative?)

---

### Pattern 8: Quality Loop

Skills self-verify before presenting findings.

**Implementation:**
```markdown
## Communication

All output passes quality verification:
- Self-verify: source attribution, assumption audit, confidence scoring
- Peer-verify: cross-functional claims validated by the owning skill
- Output format: Bottom Line → What (with confidence) → Why → How to Act → Your Decision
- Results only. Every finding tagged: 🟢 verified, 🟡 medium, 🔴 assumed.
```

**Rules:**
- Every finding tagged with confidence level
- Assumptions explicitly marked as assumptions
- "I don't know" > fake confidence
- Cross-functional claims reference the relevant skill
- High-stakes recommendations get extra scrutiny

---

### Pattern 9: Communication Standard

Structured output format for all skill output.

**Standard output:**
```
BOTTOM LINE: [One sentence answer]

WHAT:
• [Finding 1] — 🟢/🟡/🔴
• [Finding 2] — 🟢/🟡/🔴

WHY THIS MATTERS: [Business impact]

HOW TO ACT:
1. [Action] → [Owner] → [Deadline]

YOUR DECISION (if needed):
Option A: [Description] — [Trade-off]
Option B: [Description] — [Trade-off]
```

**Rules:**
- Bottom line first — always
- Max 5 bullets per section
- Actions have owners and deadlines
- Decisions framed as options with trade-offs
- No process narration ("First I analyzed...") — results only

---

### Pattern 10: Python Tools

Stdlib-only automation that provides quantitative analysis.

**Implementation:**
```python
#!/usr/bin/env python3
"""Tool description — what it does in one line."""

import json
import sys
from collections import Counter

def main():
    # Accept input from file arg or stdin
    # Process with stdlib only
    # Output JSON for programmatic use
    # Also print human-readable summary
    pass

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

**Rules:**
- **stdlib-only** — zero external dependencies (no pip install)
- **CLI-first** — run from command line with file args or stdin
- **JSON output** — structured output for integration
- **Sample data embedded** — runs with zero config for demo/testing
- **One tool, one job** — focused, not Swiss Army knife
- **Scoring tools output 0-100** — consistent scale across all tools

**Naming convention:** `snake_case_verb_noun.py` (e.g., `seo_checker.py`, `headline_scorer.py`, `churn_risk_scorer.py`)

---

## File Structure Standard

```
skill-name/
├── SKILL.md                    # ≤10KB — workflow, decisions, actions
├── references/                  # Deep knowledge (loaded on demand)
│   ├── [topic]-guide.md        # Comprehensive guide
│   ├── [topic]-benchmarks.md   # Industry data
│   └── [topic]-examples.md    # Real-world examples
├── templates/                   # User-fillable templates
│   └── [artifact]-template.md  # With placeholder markers
└── scripts/                     # Python automation
    └── [verb]_[noun].py        # Stdlib-only, CLI-first
```

**Naming rules:**
- Skill folder: `kebab-case`
- Python scripts: `snake_case.py`
- Reference docs: `kebab-case.md`
- Templates: `kebab-case-template.md`
