## 🔌 Atlassian MCP Integration

**Model Context Protocol (MCP)** enables direct integration with Jira and Confluence from Claude Code.

### Key Features

- **Direct API Access:** Create, read, update, delete Jira issues and Confluence pages
- **Bulk Operations:** Process multiple issues or pages efficiently
- **Automation:** Workflow transitions, status updates, comment additions
- **Reporting:** Generate custom reports and dashboards
- **Search:** Advanced JQL queries and Confluence searches

### Setup

The plugin bundles a pre-configured `.mcp.json` pointing at Atlassian's official Remote MCP server (`https://mcp.atlassian.com/v1/sse`). When you enable the plugin:

1. Claude Code reads `.mcp.json` and registers the `atlassian` SSE server automatically.
2. On first tool call, you're redirected to Atlassian in your browser to authenticate (OAuth) and select which Cloud sites to grant access to.
3. Tokens are managed by Claude Code — no API keys in environment variables, no credentials in the repo.

**Prerequisites:**
- An Atlassian Cloud account (free tier is sufficient — Jira Free or Confluence Free both work)
- Access to at least one Jira project or Confluence space

**No environment variables required** — the SSE transport handles OAuth automatically.

### Example Operations

> **Note:** Real tool names are camelCase and surface in Claude Code as `mcp__atlassian__<toolName>` (server key `atlassian` from the bundled `.mcp.json`; plugin-loaded installs may use a plugin-scoped prefix with the same trailing tool name). The canonical tool list lives in [references/atlassian-mcp-tools.md](references/atlassian-mcp-tools.md) — never invent tool names; capabilities not in that list (project/sprint/filter/space creation, field configuration, automation rules) are not available via MCP and require the Atlassian web UI or REST API.

```bash
# Discover accessible sites first (most tools require cloudId)
mcp__atlassian__getAccessibleAtlassianResources

# Create Jira issue
mcp__atlassian__createJiraIssue (cloudId, projectKey="PROJ", issueTypeName="Story", summary="New feature")

# Update issue status (look up the transition id first)
mcp__atlassian__getTransitionsForJiraIssue (cloudId, issueIdOrKey="PROJ-123")
mcp__atlassian__transitionJiraIssue (cloudId, issueIdOrKey="PROJ-123", transition=<id>)

# Create Confluence page (body = storage-format XHTML or ADF)
mcp__atlassian__createConfluencePage (cloudId, space, title="Sprint Retrospective", body="...")

# Run JQL query
mcp__atlassian__searchJiraIssuesUsingJql (cloudId, jql="project = PROJ AND status = 'In Progress'")
```
