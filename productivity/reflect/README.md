# reflect

Mid-conversation reflection skill. Pauses execution and **zooms out from detail-mode** to honestly reassess direction, assumptions, and bias.

## What this skill does

When invoked mid-conversation (explicitly or via implicit signals like 10+ turns deep on details without strategic check-in), the skill:

1. **Halts the current thread** and re-reads the full conversation from the original goal forward — not just recent turns
2. Runs the **5-dimension analysis framework**:
   - **Macro Perspective** — original goal vs current direction; drift detection
   - **Gap Analysis** — unverified assumptions, missing stakeholders, skipped constraints, dismissed alternatives
   - **Reflective Inquiry** — is the problem framed correctly? Right problem vs adjacent easier one? Simpler path overcomplicated? Harder valuable path avoided?
   - **Bias Check** — confirmation / sunk cost / anchoring / complexity / recency
   - **Contextual Alignment** — does direction serve actual goals + best use of time + external factors honored
3. Delivers **flowing prose** (no headers, conversational tone)
4. Ends with a **clear directional recommendation**: Continue / Pivot / Pause

## Sibling skill relationship

Productivity sibling of `capture` (Slice 1). Both share light-prompt-flow shape, max-1-question intake, fast-to-action discipline. Different mode: `capture` organizes external dumps; `reflect` re-examines internal conversation state.

## Honest-output discipline

The skill explicitly does NOT manufacture problems when things are on track. "This is solid because X" is a valid output. **Vague reassurance ("looks good!") is rejected** — when the path is solid, the skill states specific reasoning for why; when the path needs correction, the skill states specific evidence from the conversation.
